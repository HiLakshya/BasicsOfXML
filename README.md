In XML (eXtensible Markup Language), tags and attributes are fundamental components used to structure and describe data within XML documents.

1. **Tags**:
   - Tags are enclosed within angle brackets `< >` and are used to define the beginning and end of elements in XML.
   - Tags can be nested within each other to create a hierarchical structure, forming an XML tree.
   - Every XML document has one root element, which encapsulates all other elements within it.

   Example:
   ```xml
   <bookstore>
       <book>
           <title>Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone</title>
           <author>J.K. Rowling</author>
       </book>
       <book>
           <title>The Hobbit</title>
           <author>J.R.R. Tolkien</author>
       </book>
   </bookstore>
   ```

2. **Attributes**:
   - Attributes provide additional information about an element and are written within the start tag of an element.
   - Attributes consist of a name-value pair separated by an equals sign `=` and enclosed within double or single quotes.
   - Elements can have zero or more attributes.

   Example:
   ```xml
   <book isbn="9780439554930">
       <title>Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone</title>
       <author>J.K. Rowling</author>
   </book>
   ```

In this example, `isbn` is an attribute of the `<book>` element. The value `"9780439554930"` provides additional information about the book.
